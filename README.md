# Sifon Shell Dotfiles

Personal configuration files for my development environment.

Focused on speed, simplicity, and a minimal aesthetic.

## Stack
* Alacritty
* Tmux
* Fish
* NeoVim (Not here, but [here](https://vim.fisadev.com/))

## Philosophy

Everything should be fast, readable, and practical

No unnecessary plugins or visual clutter

Every keybinding and color serves a purpose

## Installation

You must have Alacritty, Tmux and Fish installed previously.

Here are just my config files. You just have to paste them in the right place.

`alacritty.toml` --> `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`

`tmux.conf` --> `~/.tmux.conf`

`fish/` --> `~/.config/fish/`

## Notes

I'm using Linux, Ubuntu, so it may not be compatible with all OS.

Best viewed in monospace fonts. (Cool fonts [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), I'm using Hurmit)
